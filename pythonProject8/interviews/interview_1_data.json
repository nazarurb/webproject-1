    "Based on the feedback provided by the Evaluation Agent, the candidate's responses did not address the interview questions effectively. Therefore, the scores are adjusted to 1 for each question. Below is the summary report:",
    "1. **Question**: Can you explain the concept of Object Relational Mapping (ORM) and how it is used in Python web development?\n   - **Candidate's Response**: Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset...\n   - **Score**: 1\n   - **Feedback**: The response did not address ORM in Python web development. It's essential to provide an explanation of ORM and its usage in this context.",
    "2. **Question**: How would you design a RESTful API using Python and Flask/Django? Can you discuss the key components and best practices involved?\n   - **Candidate's Response**: Feature selection and engineering are critical steps in a machine learning project...\n   - **Score**: 1\n   - **Feedback**: The response did not focus on designing a RESTful API using Python and Flask/Django. Ensure to discuss key components and best practices in API design.",
    "3. **Question**: What is the significance of asynchronous programming in Python back-end development? Can you provide examples of when and how asynchronous programming can be beneficial in improving performance and scalability of web applications?\n   - **Candidate's Response**: When evaluating the performance of a machine learning model, metrics depend on the task...\n   - **Score**: 1\n   - **Feedback**: The response did not address the significance of asynchronous programming in Python back-end development. Provide examples related to improving performance and scalability of web applications using asynchronous programming.",
    "Overall Conclusion: The candidate's responses did not demonstrate a clear understanding of the topics related to Python web development, API design, and asynchronous programming. Further preparation and focus on the specific areas of inquiry are recommended for future interviews."
